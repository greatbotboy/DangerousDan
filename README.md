# DangerousDan Drive Wiper
Don't use this!!! You will wipe your drives!!!
 
I am not responsible for what you do with this.
 
You have been warned.
 
# Automated Destruction
 
DangerousDan looks for an attached block device and when detected uses shred to destroy all data on the disk.
 
# Why?
 
We needed an automated system for wiping old HDDs before they are chucked in the bin. and seriously who doesn't love the thought of accidentally wiping their system drives while writing and modifying a program.

# Usage
```
Run ./Danger.py
Plug in any block device
Wait
Cry???
```
